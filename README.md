🧠 AI Image Caption Recommendation System using CLIP
This project builds a retrieval-based image captioning system that recommends the most relevant captions for a given image. It leverages OpenAI's CLIP model (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) to understand both images and textual descriptions in the same embedding space.

🎯 Objective
Instead of generating captions from scratch (as in traditional captioning systems), this system retrieves the most relevant captions from a set of candidates by:

Encoding both image and text data using CLIP.

Calculating cosine similarity between the image embedding and candidate caption embeddings.

Ranking captions based on similarity and presenting the top-N matches.

💡 How It Works
📷 Input: An image is provided as input by the user.

🧠 Embedding Extraction:

The image is encoded using the CLIP image encoder.

A set of predefined candidate captions are encoded using the CLIP text encoder.

📊 Similarity Matching:

Cosine similarity is computed between the image embedding and each caption embedding.

Captions are ranked based on similarity scores.

✅ Output: Top-K captions are presented as the best matches for the image.

Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

CLIP by OpenAI (openai/CLIP)

Torch (PyTorch) – For model loading and inference

NumPy, scikit-learn – For vector and similarity calculations

Matplotlib / PIL – For image handling and visualization

Jupyter Notebook – For prototyping and interactive testing

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clip-caption-retrieval.git
cd clip-caption-retrieval
2. Install Dependencies
You can install required packages via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch torchvision ftfy regex tqdm
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
3. Prepare Your Data
Place your test images inside the images/ directory.

Provide a list of candidate captions inside a file like captions.txt (one caption per line).

4. Run the Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook image_caption_retrieval.ipynb
Or integrate the logic into a Python script.

📈 Sample Output

1. A group of people riding horses on a beach.
2. Horse riders galloping along the shore.
3. Riders enjoying a sunset ride on the coast.
🔍 Evaluation
Evaluation is done qualitatively using similarity scores and visually confirming the relevance of top-ranked captions. You can also:

Track average similarity scores

Compare results with other baseline methods

Experiment with different caption sets

💡 Future Enhancements
Integrate semantic diversity filters to avoid near-duplicate caption recommendations.

Add a web-based UI for users to upload images and see results in real time.

Enable multi-language support using multilingual text encoders.

Extend the system for video caption retrieval using keyframe embeddings.
